# Library Project

This is an assignment from the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

[Here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) is the project brief.

[Here](https://bdaniels8135.github.io/library-project/) is a live preview of the my submission.

The original assignment involved basic object literals. Later in the course we were encouraged to revisit our code to implement classes, closures, etc. as appropriate.
